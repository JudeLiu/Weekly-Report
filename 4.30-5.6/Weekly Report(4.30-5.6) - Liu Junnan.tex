\section{Work Done}
This week I finished assignment 1 of cs231n, of which I will introduce the details regarding the implementation.

\subsection{Assignment1}
\subsubsection{Linear SVM}
Recall that for the $i$-th example we are given the pixels of image $x_i$ and the label $y_i$ that specifies the index of the correct class. The score function takes the pixels and computes the vector $f(x_i,W)$ of class scores, which is abbreviated to $s$ (short for scores). For example, the score for the $j$-th class is the $j$-th element: $s_j=f(x_i,W)_j$. The Multiclass SVM loss for the $i$-th example is then formalized as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
L_i=\sum_{j \ne y} \max(0,s_j - s_{y_i} + \Delta)
\label{eqn:svm-loss}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\Delta$ is set to $1$ in this experiment, and since we only experiment linear SVM, the activation function $f$ is also linear.

The gradient with respect to $W_{y_i}$ is
$$\frac{\partial L_i}{\partial W_{y_i}}= -\left(\sum_{j \ne y_i} \mathbf{1}(w_j^T x_i - w_{y_t}^T x_i + 1 > 0)\right)x_i $$
where $\mathbf{1}$ is the indicator function that is one if the condition inside is true or zero otherwise. For the other rows where $j \ne y_i$ the gradient is:
$$\frac{\partial L_i}{\partial W_j} = \mathbf{1}(w_j^T x_i - w_{y_i}^T x_i + 1 > 0)x_i$$

First look at the trivial version of this:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
loss = 0.0
for i in range(num_train):
  scores = X[i].dot(W)
  correct_class_score = scores[y[i]]
  for j in range(num_classes):
    if j == y[i]:
      continue
    margin = scores[j] - correct_class_score + 1 # note delta = 1
    if margin > 0:
      dW[:, j] += X[i]
      dW[:, y[i]] -= X[i]
      loss += margin

# Right now the loss is a sum over all training examples, but we want it
# to be an average instead so we divide by num_train.
loss /= num_train
dW /= num_train

# Add regularization to the loss.
loss += reg * np.sum(W * W)
dW += reg * W
\end{lstlisting}

This part of code just accomplishes forward pass of computing loss and backward pass of computing gradient, with loops. But vectorization is always preferred.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python,numbers=left]
scores = X.dot(W)
scores = scores - scores[range(num_train), y].reshape((-1,1)) + 1
scores[scores<0] = 0
scores[range(num_train), y] = 0
loss = np.sum(scores) / num_train
loss += 0.5 * reg * np.sum(W**2)
scores[scores>0] = 1
scores[range(num_train), y] = -np.sum(scores, axis=1)
dW = X.T.dot(scores) / num_train + reg * W
\end{lstlisting}
Line 1 simply computes $W^TX$. But line 2 is quite tricky. Notice that the loss function of SVM(Eqn\ref{eqn:svm-loss}) requires each row of the score matrix to subtract the $y_i$-th element of that row, except the $y_i$-th one. In line 2, ``scores[range(num\_train), y]" just indexes $y_i$-th element of each row. For example, num\_train is 3, and y=[3,1,2]. ``scores[range(num\_train), y]" will retrieve scores[0][3], scores[1][1] and scores[2][2]. I have to say that with numpy the code will be concise and elegant. To meet the dimension constraint of broadcasting, we have to reshape the result of ``scores[range(num\_train), y]" to make it a ``column vector''. Line 3 is the $\max$ operation that makes all the elements less than zero zero.

There is also experiment to compare the time cost between them. The time of naive version that computes loss and gradients is 0.090697s, and the time of vectorized version is 0.004672s. We can see that vectorized one is about 19.4 times faster than naive one.

The assignment also needs us to tune the hyperparameters of SVMs, such as learning rate and regularization strength. Tuning hyperparameter is a tricky task needing a lot of engineering practices. The course provides a note where lists many useful rules of thumb as follows.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Search hyperparameters on log scale. For example, a typical sampling of the learning rate would look as follows: ``learning\_rate = 10 ** np.random.uniform(-6,1)''.
    \item Prefer random search to grid search.
\end{itemize}
Then we can shrink the range to search for better results. After tuning hyperparameters, I get 0.392 accuracy on validation set and 0.377 on test set.

\subsubsection{Softmax Classifier}
The softmax exercise is analogous to SVM exercise, so I will only introduce how to implement loss and gradients.

Softmax loss is defined as follows:
$$L_i=-\log\left( \frac{e^{f_{y_i}}}{\sum_j e^{f_j}}\right)=-f_{y_i}+\sum_j e^{f_j}$$

And the gradient with respect to $W$ is
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\partial L_i}{\partial W_j}=
\left\{ 
    \begin{array}{ll}
        \frac{e^{f_{y_i}}}{\sum_j e^{f_j}}X_i^T & \mbox{,if $i \ne j$}\\
        \left(\frac{e^{f_{y_i}}}{\sum_j e^{f_j}}-1\right)X_i^T & \mbox{,if $i = j$}
    \end{array}
\right.
\end{eqnarray*}

In practice we usually subtract maximum of all the scores from each scores to guarantee numerical stability.
$$\frac{e^{f_{y_i}}}{\sum_j e^{f_j}}=\frac{Ce^{f_{y_i}}}{C\sum_j e^{f_j}}=\frac{e^{f_{y_i}+\log C}}{\sum_j e^{f_j+\log C}}$$
where $C=-\max_j f_j$.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=python, numbers=left]
scores = X.dot(W)
shift_scores = scores - scores.max(axis=1).reshape((-1,1))

softmax_output = np.exp(shift_scores)
softmax_sum = np.sum(softmax_output, axis=1)

loss = - np.sum(shift_scores[range(num_train), y]) + np.sum(np.log(softmax_sum))
loss = loss / num_train +  0.5 * reg * np.sum(W**2)

prob = softmax_output / softmax_sum.reshape((-1,1))
prob[range(num_train), y] -= 1
dW = np.dot(X.T, prob)
dW = dW / num_train + reg * W
\end{lstlisting}

After tuned, the classifier yields 0.357 accuracy on validation set and also 0.357 on test set.

\subsubsection{Two layer Neural Network}
The model in the exercise consists of an input layer, a hidden layer with ReLU activation, another hidden layer with linear activation and an output layer with softmax loss. The forward pass is easy:
\begin{lstlisting}
fc1 = np.maximum(X.dot(W1)+ b1 ,0)
scores = fc1.dot(W2) + b2
shift_scores = scores - np.max(scores, axis=1).reshape((-1,1))
softmax_output = np.exp(shift_scores)
softmax_sum = np.sum(softmax_output, axis=1)
softmax_loss = - np.sum(shift_scores[range(N), y]) + np.sum(np.log(softmax_sum))
regularization = 0.5 * reg * (np.sum(W1**2) + np.sum(W2**2))
loss = softmax_loss / N + regularization
\end{lstlisting} 

\begin{lstlisting}
dscores = softmax_output / softmax_sum.reshape((-1,1))
dscores[range(N), y] -= 1
dscores /= N
dW2 = np.dot(fc1.T, dscores) + reg * W2
db2 = np.sum(dscores, axis=0)

dfc1 = dscores.dot(W2.T)
drelu = (fc1 > 0) * dfc1

dW1 = np.dot(X.T, drelu) + reg * W1
db1 = drelu.sum(0)
\end{lstlisting}
As for the back propagation, the gradient of the score is the the same as previous softmax exercise. Recall that ReLU function is formalized as $f(x)=\max(0,x)$. Therefore the derivative of ReLU is $$\frac{df}{dx}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
  1 & \mbox{if $f>0$}\\
  0 & \mbox{if $f=0$}
\end{array}\right.$$

Tuning neural net is a bit tougher than SVM or softmax classifier, because the network architecture is also a hyperparameter. Specifically in this exercise we have to tune the number of neurons of hidden layers. Increasing the size of hidden layer will help improving the performance, but will result in the problem of overfitting, and also needs more iterations of training. I tried many combinations of hidden layer size, learning rate and regularization, with the technique of log scale search and random search mentioned in Sec. 1.1.1 between Line 092 and 095, setting hidden layer size as 500, learning rate as 0.001 and regularization factor as 0.27 results relatively good performance of 0.495 accuracy on validation set and 0.494 on test set. Keeping increasing hidden layer size will improve the accuracy just a little bit, but the training time is much longer, plus the overfitting issue.

Here is the table that compares the performance of Linear SVM, softmax classifier and two layer neural network on test set:
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
  \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
    \hline
    & SVM & softmax & NN\\
    \hline
    accuracy & 0.377 & 0.357 & 0.494\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

SVM and softmax produce close results, and it is obvious that neural net is much better than both of them.

\subsection{Numpy exercises}
This week I have completed half(50) of the numpy exercises. The exercises cover both basic and advanced numpy functions, some of which are quite useful for implementing deep learning algorithms. For example function np.pad can do zero padding for us. np.linspace will create evenly spaced numbers over a specified interval, for instance, np.linspace(0,1,5) will return array [0., 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.], which is helpful when we want to do grid search or generate x coordinates for plotting.

\section{Plans}
In the next week I will continue cs231n course ,start assignment 2 of cs231 and finish numpy exercises.
